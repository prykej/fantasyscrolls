The Arne joins the Great River south of Thentis. The valley, which lies to the east of Thentis, is a picturesque and lush area filled with great estates, vineyards, olive groves and orchards. The Arne Valley has been settled for almost a thousand years and has been a popular spot for summer homes for the elite of Thentis \(especially when the Great Canal is reeking in high summer\).
