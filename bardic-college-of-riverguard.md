### **Bardic College of Riverguard**

Under the patronage of Taz Silvertongue, a bardic college was established in the growing community of Riverguard. Students at this college are provided room, board and lessons. Those students who are unable to pay the college fees work in a local inn, The Weary Traveller, which is also owned by Silvertongue.
