One of the former rulers of Cinnabar, the mage Eikon was best known for his lust for arcane power and his willingness to undertake almost any task \(and any risk\) in its pursuit. The Apocrypha of Eikon is a tome reputedly written by this mage and is said to be a guide to some of the more occult aspects of inter-planar travel. Legend states that this tome is protected by a powerful curse and should be handled with extreme care.
