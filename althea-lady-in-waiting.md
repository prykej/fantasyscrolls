### **Althea, Lady-in-Waiting**

One of the many attendants serving Princessa Irmé, Althea was tasked with educating Sandra Thorinsen in the courtly arts and protocols of the Lamartine clan in advance of Sandra’s adoption into the family. A prim, delicate figure, Althea is a firm but effective teacher and a source of wise counsel on the practices of this ancient family and clan politics.
