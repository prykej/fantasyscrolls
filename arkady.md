### **Arkady**

Not much is known of this enigmatic figure other than that he was once held prisoner \(along with many others\) by the Lichmage known as the Chancellor. He presents as a human midget dressed in colourful and opulent robes, much as a court jester at a rich court. He is presumed to possess certain magical talents, the extent of which are mostly unknown.
