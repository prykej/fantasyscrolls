> **Agros**\(Patron God – Ptah, Trading Specialties – Wood, Tin, Jade, Pipeweed\)

One of the oldest cities within the League, Agros is known for its passion for public games, feasts and other outward displays of ostentatious wealth. Many leading families claim ancestry from the nobility of Westmark but, as any citizen in the League knows, wealth is the only nobility that a person truly requires.

A colony of hobbits is responsible for the cultivation of pipeweed. Some claim that there is a link between the worship of Ptah and the consumption of this product. Most traders in pipeweed discourage this belief since it is thought to limit the market.

The symbol of this city is a green snake with its tale in its mouth against a white background.
