One of the many songs written by Taz Silvertongue. An excerpt is included below.

  


> “I’m not a soldier or sailor,  
> A butcher or a tailor  
> I’m just a wanderer,  
> It’s just the way I am.

> We’re not tiny, just far away.  
> You won’t see us coming  
> Our presence is stunning  
> The band who looks far away.

> Whether goblin or ogre,  
> either drunk or sober,  
> the smashing and bashing  
> the holds we are trashing.

> We’re not tiny, just far away.  
> You won’t see us coming  
> Our presence is stunning  
> The band who looks far away.
