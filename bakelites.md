This ancient race of human stock was fabled for its ability to forge armour and weapons of superior quality and inherent magical attributes. Under their kings and warlords, the Bakelites fought an ongoing war with various neighbours. Although victorious many times, low fertility rates among this race meant that warriors lost in these battles were not quickly replaced and their power faced an inevitable decline.

The last remnants of this race faded from the world over three centuries ago, taking their magic with them. Although many Bakelite artifacts remain \(distinguished by their rust red colouring and fine craftwork\), the loss of their magical abilities has severely depressed their value. Legend states that the tomb of the legendary warlord Ulafang was built within the halls of the last Bakelite fortress.
