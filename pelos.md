**Pelos**\(Patron God - Marduk, Trading Specialties â€“ Iron, Whale Oil, Fish, Wheat\)

Sometimes called the end of the known earth, the City of Pelos is famed for the quality of its navigators and the bravery of its sailors. Like Oldburgh, its roots are found in the ancient Empire of Westmark. Aside from the Citadel and great lighthouse, Pelos has no other architectural legacy from ancient times.

Pelos is known as a gritty, hard-working place. Its reliance on whaling and iron production means that the town is dominated by harsh smells, from which only a native-born resident appears to be immune. The city is a focus point of the wheat trade, which is grown in the hinterland areas along the western coast.

The symbol of the city is a white lighthouse against an aquamarine background.
