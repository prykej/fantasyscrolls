**Chelkis**\(Patron God – Apollo, Trading Specialties – Marble, Artisanal Goods, Furs\)

Second only to Thentis in the quality and reputation of its artisans, Chelkis appears to be a city that is clearly on the rise. Although the trading magnates wield great power, they must be sensitive to the wishes and concerns of the tradespeople and crafters within the city. The constitution of the City stipulates that the two Archons \(chief magistrates\) be of different genders.

The symbol of this city is a golden horizontal arrow against a brown three string lyre on a pale green background.
