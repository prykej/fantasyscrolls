### Cities of the Southron League {#cities-of-the-southron-league}

The Southron League is a loose alliance of the trading cities that are found along the southern coast of the continent. Although the differences may be significant, each city is ruled by a council led by a chief magistrate \(or two chief magistrates, as in the case of Agros, Chelkis and Pessig\). Each city has its own hinterland and trading specialties.

Although competition between cities is fierce, it is confined to trading prominence and prestige rather than open combat \(mostly\). As well as common enemies, such as pirates and savage races, there is a fair amount of inter-marriage between the great trading houses, which solidifies the common bond between cities.

The last serious breech in relations between the cities of the League occurred over 80 years ago. Called the Serpentine War, this contest pitted merchants in Jeru, Nepenthe and Agros against their rivals in Salis, Nembrod and Pessig, with the other cities remaining neutral or, in the case of Chelkis and Pelos, having factions supporting both sides. Hostilities extended over seven years and mostly consisted of raids and piracy rather than large-scale battles.

To remain free of the predations of great wizards, monstrous creatures and such, each of the cities has a patron god. Although matters of faith are left to individuals \(and religious disharmony hinders trade\), the official cult of each city focuses on the patron god. At times, these gods let their wishes be known to the city leaders – and divine rivalries can sometimes have worldly consequences.

The cities are discussed in order from East to West.

**Oldburgh**\(Patron God – Odin, Trading Specialties – Furs, Spices, Rice, Artisanal Goods\)

Originally an outpost of Westmark, Oldburgh has grown into a major trading port in its own right. Like Thentis, the “old city” shows remnants of the Westmark architecture, including canals that are built off of the main channel of the Great River.

Although Oldburgh is a recognized maritime power, it has an uneasy relationship with the Lizardkin who live in the swampy areas of the Great River delta. As long as the Lizardkin keep to themselves, do not harass the trade going upriver and keep the peace with the inhabitants close to the city, the magnates of Oldburgh are content to live and let live. Some magnates have established trade relations with the Lizardkin while others believe that their extermination would improve the city’s wealth and security.

The City of Oldburgh is defended by a civilian militia supported by a cadre of professional soldiers and warriors. Although of a lower status than the merchant families, service as an officer within the militia can be an honourable profession for someone unlikely to inherit a family business or position. Recent skirmishes with the Lizardkin have tested the city’s defences but relations have been generally peaceful.

The symbol of this city is a grey tower against a green background.

**Nepenthe**\(Patron God – Athena, Trading Specialties – Iron, Tin, Copper, Wine\)

Almost a millennium old, Nepenthe is one of the newer cities in the League. It was established by the Paladin Metronius, Leader of the Golden Legion, with the intention of bringing law, justice and Athenian truth to the coast. It was funded by the Hoard of Sitheritimax, a powerful Green Dragon that held significant sway over the Iron Hills in the years prior to its death at the hands of the Paladin and his followers.

Nepenthe is known for its wine and spirituous liquors. The wine benefits from the unique micro-climate of the area, the positioning of the vineyards, and the superior techniques of harvesting and fermentation. The local culture points to the role of their patron goddess, with the thought that wine confers \(and deprives\) wisdom on the drinkers.

**Jeru**\(Patron God – Poseidon, Trading Specialties – Fur, Silver, Gold\)

Although it is many generations past its glorious prime, the City of Jeru is still a force to be reckoned with within the League. Although they tend to make the city a target for adventurers and pirates, its famous mines produce fantastic wealth which are the main bulwark of its power.

Jeru is the original home of Lord Metrobius, a noted warrior who suppressed the notorious pirate league called the Children of the Kraken. The tales of his six-year campaign against the Children of the Kraken are legendary, filled with heroic deeds, perseverance against the stormy seas, and epic sea battles. Jeru is also the titular home of The Red Company, a famous mercenary unit.

The symbol of this city is a red Wyvern against a vertically split background of white and green.

**Agros**\(Patron God – Ptah, Trading Specialties – Wood, Tin, Jade, Pipeweed\)

One of the oldest cities within the League, Agros is known for its passion for public games, feasts and other outward displays of ostentatious wealth. Many leading families claim ancestry from the nobility of Westmark but, as any citizen in the League knows, wealth is the only nobility that a person truly requires.

A colony of hobbits is responsible for the cultivation of pipeweed. Some claim that there is a link between the worship of Ptah and the consumption of this product. Most traders in pipeweed discourage this belief since it is thought to limit the market.

The symbol of this city is a green snake with its tale in its mouth against a white background.

**Chelkis**\(Patron God – Apollo, Trading Specialties – Marble, Artisanal Goods, Furs\)

Second only to Thentis in the quality and reputation of its artisans, Chelkis appears to be a city that is clearly on the rise. Although the trading magnates wield great power, they must be sensitive to the wishes and concerns of the tradespeople and crafters within the city. The constitution of the City stipulates that the two Archons \(chief magistrates\) be of different genders.

The symbol of this city is a golden horizontal arrow against a brown three string lyre on a pale green background.

**Moro**\(Patron God – Thor, Trading Specialties – Iron, Coal, Forged Goods\)

This city is the most warlike within the League. Some state that this is due to the patronage of Thor. Others say it is because it is closest to the pirates and occupies the most strategic position covering southern trade. Perhaps both reasons are true. Regardless, the forges of Moro have gained a justifiable reputation for high quality workmanship, especially with regard to weaponry. The combative nature of this community makes it a good recruiting ground for mercenaries.

The symbol of this city is a representation of Thor’s Hammer surmounting a green hill with a blue sky.

**Salis**\(Patron God – Isis, Trading Specialties – Wood, Furs, Ebony, Wool\)

Salis sits at the mouth of the Tansey River, which gives it access to an extensive hinterland in the Iron Hills. While trade is the main activity of every city in the League, Salis is home to a powerful mystery cult under the patronage of the Goddess Isis. No one can rise to power within the city without the backing of the cult, which is known to have its tentacles \(as charming and desirable as they are\) many places within the League \(and beyond\). Varia of Isis is known to be a leading member of this organization.

The city plan consists of four concentric walls, with the lowest level serving the harbour, docks and warehouses and the highest reserved for the religious, noble and mercantile elites. Salis maintains a small professional army under the leadership of Imbro Shieldbreaker supported by local militia units. The Third Salis Regiment served with distinction in the Battle of Losimar Gap against the Orcish army led by the Hidden General.

The symbol of this city is a gold ring on a navy blue background.

**Nembrod**\(Patron God – Njord, Trading Specialties – Spices, Silk, Ships\)

In addition to the trade in luxury goods, Nembrod is known for the quality of its ship building. Ships built in the city are known to be faster and more durable than others, even though the designs are often replicated elsewhere. Is it the local wood? The craftsmen? Or a special blessing of the old god?

As a city, Nembrod styles itself as the paragon of advanced virtues and civilization. The streets and harbour are well maintained and the public buildings and spaces are elegant and impressive. Inhabitants are required to maintain a certain standard of hygiene and appearance, with fines assessed to those who appear in untidy or worn out clothing.

Begging is strictly outlawed and it is a crime to be poor or homeless within the city \(with exile being the most common punishment\). Those entering Nembrod must show a personal wealth of at least 20 gold pieces before they are allowed to enter the city gates or disembark in the harbour.

**Urkel**\(Patron God - Demeter, Trading Specialties – Wheat, Salt, Dyes, Olives\)

In contrast to Moro, Urkel has a reputation as the most peaceable of the cities within the League. The magnates of the city would rather hire mercenaries, or contribute to the upkeep of other fleets, than to build their own warships or raise troops from within their own city walls. They are content to ignore the jeers of those who question the virility of the city while they count the gold pieces in their vaults.

A genteel and highly cultured city, Urkel maintains a small but robust community of sages, artists, dancers, poets and actors. Bards can always find a welcome audience here. Public celebrations follow the agricultural cycle feature many public spectacles that display local talents.

The symbol of this city is a golden sheaf of wheat against a slashed background of grey and blue.

**Pessig**\(Patron God – Uller, Trading Specialties – Spices, Fish, Furs\)

The city of Pessig was founded by three holy sisters who were directed to found a colony by a vision granted by the God Uller. Residents of the city are known for their almost reckless approach to life, hazarding fortunes on risky ventures or making absurd bets. Their foolhardiness is only matched by their luck.

Life in the city is happy-go-lucky. The belief that fortune can make or break anyone leads to an odd form of social unity. A rich man today might be a poor one tomorrow, which gives hope to the poor and a sense of social responsibility among the wealthy.

The symbol of this city is a bronze wheel containing eight spokes against a white background.

**Pelos**\(Patron God - Marduk, Trading Specialties – Iron, Whale Oil, Fish, Wheat\)

Sometimes called the end of the known earth, the City of Pelos is famed for the quality of its navigators and the bravery of its sailors. Like Oldburgh, its roots are found in the ancient Empire of Westmark. Aside from the Citadel and great lighthouse, Pelos has no other architectural legacy from ancient times.

Pelos is known as a gritty, hard-working place. Its reliance on whaling and iron production means that the town is dominated by harsh smells, from which only a native-born resident appears to be immune. The city is a focus point of the wheat trade, which is grown in the hinterland areas along the western coast.

The symbol of the city is a white lighthouse against an aquamarine background.
