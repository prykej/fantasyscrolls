Of the many masons and craftspeople attracted to the massive building projects of Metrobius, Albius is noted more for his continual attendance at wine shops and ale houses, and liberal purse, than for his work ethic or supposed skill as a mason. It is rumoured that he is not a mason at all but a spy in the service of the Trestevi Clan of Thentis.
