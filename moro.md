> **Moro**\(Patron God – Thor, Trading Specialties – Iron, Coal, Forged Goods\)

This city is the most warlike within the League. Some state that this is due to the patronage of Thor. Others say it is because it is closest to the pirates and occupies the most strategic position covering southern trade. Perhaps both reasons are true. Regardless, the forges of Moro have gained a justifiable reputation for high quality workmanship, especially with regard to weaponry. The combative nature of this community makes it a good recruiting ground for mercenaries.

The symbol of this city is a representation of Thor’s Hammer surmounting a green hill with a blue sky.
