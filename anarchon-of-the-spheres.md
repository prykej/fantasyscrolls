This baleful non-human wizard maintains a hold in the middle reaches of the Spine of the World. This being specializes in the practice of necromantic sorceries and is the owner of a magic artefact known as the Ghost Fence, which is composed of thousands of skulls, of all varieties, to create a protective magical barrier. He appears as a faceless cloaked figure emanating a negative energy aura and standing on a floating three-foot diameter sphere. Anarchon had joined Lakka Thornheart in the latter’s pursuit of Fátor Waddlebottom. After suffering defeat at the hands of Zelmayn Rowanstaff in the Battle of the Scar, Anarchon retreated to his hold.
