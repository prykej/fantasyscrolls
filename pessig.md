**Pessig**\(Patron God – Uller, Trading Specialties – Spices, Fish, Furs\)

The city of Pessig was founded by three holy sisters who were directed to found a colony by a vision granted by the God Uller. Residents of the city are known for their almost reckless approach to life, hazarding fortunes on risky ventures or making absurd bets. Their foolhardiness is only matched by their luck.

Life in the city is happy-go-lucky. The belief that fortune can make or break anyone leads to an odd form of social unity. A rich man today might be a poor one tomorrow, which gives hope to the poor and a sense of social responsibility among the wealthy.

The symbol of this city is a bronze wheel containing eight spokes against a white background.
