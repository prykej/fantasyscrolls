Adventuring can be a hard life but life after adventuring can also have its challenges. Ambergis, a noted warrior in his day, is an example of one of those who has neither the fortune to go to their god nor the luck to amass personal wealth or stake out their own hold. Rather than settling down with a religious community or finding a comfortable berth with a charitable lord or temple, Ambergis finds the need to continue his wandering ways. An affable storyteller, he can often cadge a place to stay at a local tavern or count on a few days hospitality with minor lords.
