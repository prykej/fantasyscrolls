This ancient and holy druid is the master of the Centaur Grove, which is rumoured to be somewhere in the headwaters of the Great River. No one knows if Antonius created the Grove, which can only be found by his permission, or if he found this magical otherworldly place. A clan of centaurs inhabit the Grove and assist the Archdruid in his tasks. An ancient large-scale forge is located within the grove.
