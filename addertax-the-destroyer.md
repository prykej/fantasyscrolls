This ancient red dragon is known for his extended persecution of Gnomes almost a thousand years ago. His destructive and malicious nature is the subject of legend and is the primary cause for the Gnomes to flee the Gnomelands. Given the amount of treasure extorted from the Gnomes as well as the other activities of this predatory monster, the size of Addertaxâ€™s hoard, has been the subject of great speculation. It is not known if Addertax is still living but the area that he used to terrorize has been taken over by a white dragon of lesser repute called Eukanol.
