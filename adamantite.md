One of the famous alchemical elements, adamantite is used for the manufacture of adamantine, a metal of high durability and enchantability. Like mithril, adamantite is rare and is mined by dwarves, deep gnomes or deep-dwelling humanoids. Adamantite can only be purified into adamantine using special furnaces that employ elemental fire.
