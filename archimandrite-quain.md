This elderly gnome is the cleric in charge of the Temple of Garl Glittergold in Thentis. While not the main church of this religion, it is considered one of the handsome and prestigious \(temples to Garl in most gnome communities are hidden\). The temple is the focus of the gnome community in Thentis and the Archimandrite is assisted by a variety of deacons and lesser clerics in serving their spiritual \(and often temporal\) needs.

The Archimandrite was an early patron of Bardach the Beneficent, who is a deacon in the Thentis Temple.
